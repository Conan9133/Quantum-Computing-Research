# 🌍 Applications and Examples

This section will explore **practical applications** of quantum computing and showcase real-world-inspired quantum programs.

## 🎯 Planned Examples

- Solving systems of equations
- Quantum finance examples
- Optimization problems with VQE/QAOA
- Machine learning basics (e.g., quantum classifiers)
- Running circuits on real IBM quantum hardware

## 🚀 Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ VQLS for Linear Pendulum |
| ✅ VQLS for non-linear Pendulum |
| ✅ Testing VQLS Limitations |
| ✅ QAOA (coming soon) | QAOA for real-world problems    |

## 💡 How This Will Be Used

This part will serve as a bridge between learning algorithms and applying them to solve problems or model systems.
