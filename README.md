# Quantum Computing Journey 🧠⚛️

This is a personal learning repository where I document my progress in quantum computing, starting from fundamentals to implementing real quantum algorithms using Qiskit.

- ✍️ Step-by-step implementations of key algorithms
- ⚙️ Hands-on code in Jupyter notebooks
- 📁 Well-organized folders mirroring the Qiskit workflow and key concepts
- 🧠 My personal notes, insights, and experiments

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `1_basics_and_qiskit_workflow/`: Foundational concepts, Qiskit basics, gates, measurements.
- `2_algorithms_from_scratch/`: Manual construction of QFT, QPE, HHL, VQLS and others.
- `3_applications_and_examples/`: Real-world or illustrative projects like quantum teleportation, QRNG, etc.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Build an intuitive and practical understanding of quantum computing
- Implement quantum algorithms step-by-step without relying on black-box libraries
- Understand Qiskit’s workflow: problem → circuit → transpile → execute → analyze
- Simulate and run quantum circuits on IBM Quantum systems
