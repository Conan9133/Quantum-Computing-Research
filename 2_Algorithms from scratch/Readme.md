# Quantum Algorithms from Scratch

This section contains implementations of fundamental quantum algorithms **built from scratch**, using basic quantum gates and principles. The goal is to deeply understand how each algorithm works under the hood, without relying on high-level Qiskit libraries.

## 📌 Structure

Each subfolder includes:

- 📄 A Jupyter notebook or Python script that builds the algorithm step by step
- 🧠 Comments and explanations alongside code
- 📈 Optional: Circuit diagrams, statevector visualizations, and measurement outcomes

## 🚀 Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) | Manual implementation of QFT and its inverse using Hadamards and controlled rotations |
| ✅ Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) | Estimate eigenphases by constructing controlled unitary circuits from scratch |
| ✅ HHL Algorithm | Quantum linear systems solver — to be built from basic gates |
| ✅ Quantum Adders (coming soon) | Circuit-based binary adders using quantum logic | 
| ✅ VQLS | Variational Quantum Linear Solver — variational approach from scratch |
| ✅ QAOA | Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm -    |

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Qiskit installed.
2. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
3. Navigate to a specific algorithm folder and open the `.ipynb` file.
4. Run the notebook cells to step through the construction and simulation of the circuit.

## 📚 Prerequisites

Before using this section, make sure you're comfortable with:

- Basic Qiskit syntax
- Quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, phase gates)
- Concepts like entanglement, measurement, and quantum superposition

If not, see [01_Basics_and_Workflow](../01_Basics_and_Workflow) first.
